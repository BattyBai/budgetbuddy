## Challenges
* Learning Ruby - definetaly a semantic, but uncerimonial language. I prefer the ceromony of JS or even python
* Pulling data between tables on individual index pages was challenges
* Existential crisis on who coded this: Me or Rails?
* Adding a field to Devise; tried making another realtional table that didn't work.

## Learned 
* Devise - so dope. Got user auth and One to many! 
* I now know I can 'learn' a language in 2 weeks
* Ruby is awesome becuase there is a ton of documentation. Since it's so structured, it's likely someone has a solution. 
* Double edged sword; since it's so structured doing something different, you're kkinda blazing your own path
## What would I do Differently?
* not spend AS much time researching and learning. 
* more time just coding
* Not try to React Rails
## Missing functionality
* Red/Green/Black based on accounts
* Filtering
* Search function
* Styling
* Using React in the frontend-
